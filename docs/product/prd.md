# rwxmap — PRD

## The floor (start here)

Every operation starts at its method's floor. The floor is each method's
own measured truth lean over the 1478-row labelled corpus. It is a
starting value, never an early return (D42).

| method | n | truth r | truth w | truth x | floor |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| GET / HEAD / OPTIONS | 550 | 97% | 1% | 2% | **r** |
| POST | 509 | 17% | 20% | 62% | **x** |
| PUT | 127 | 2% | 83% | 15% | **w** |
| DELETE | 250 | 0% | 81% | 19% | **w** |
| PATCH | 42 | 0% | 69% | 31% | **w** |

**Movement rule.** A rule moves a class exactly one step, and only
between `w` and `x`. Raising is `w -> x`. Lowering is `x -> w`. Nothing
lowers to `r`: `r` comes from the GET floor and nowhere else.

One direction of travel per method (D43):

- GET / HEAD / OPTIONS — no word rules run. The floor stands.
- POST — lower only, `x -> w`.
- PUT / DELETE / PATCH — raise only, `w -> x`.

## The three goals

Work one goal at a time and bring them together afterwards. Attacking
several at once is what caused the repeated failures: they have
different shapes and need different evidence. Counts are the current
classifier's errors over the 1478 labelled rows.

| # | error | count | where it lives | why it matters |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **w dressed as x** | 178 | POST 103, DELETE 47, PUT 22, PATCH 6 | a safe write is treated as dangerous, so it gets blocked when it should not be |
| 2 | **x dressed as w** | 10 | PATCH 6, DELETE 3, PUT 1 | a dangerous operation is treated as a safe write — this is the leak |
| 3 | **r dressed as x or w** | 26 | POST 24 (r->x), PUT 2 (r->w) | a pure read is treated as a write. Deferred: smallest and least harmful |

Separately, 17 GET rows leak on one vendor (Slack). GET runs no word
rules by design, so these are out of the three goals and are not chased
per-vendor.

Goal 1 makes a safe action needlessly inaccessible. Goal 2 makes a risky
action wrongly accessible. Goal 3 is the same shape as goal 1, one step
further out, and waits.

## Where the work is

M1, the informed arbiter, is a POC and has not graduated. The full
module ladder, the M1 go/no-go gate, the labelled sets and the current
arbiter shape with its scores live in
[module ladder and arbiter shape](../wiki/module-ladder-and-shape.md).
Decisions D1-D45 are in [the decisions log](../wiki/decisions-log.md).
M0 is closed; its gate statement and results are in
[go/no-go gate and M0 results](../logs/gate-and-m0-results.md). Notes
carried from the original outline are in
[design notes](../logs/design-notes.md).

## Problem & goal

The -02 draft
(`justabit:ietf/v3/docs/draft-hamr-oauth-agent-delegation-02.xml`, anchor
`classification`) defines two ways a request's `actionClass` gets
decided. Under `classSource` **method**, the class comes from the HTTP
method alone: GET, HEAD, and OPTIONS default to `r`; PUT and DELETE
default to `w`; POST and PATCH default to `x` (lines 810-816). Under
`classSource` **declared**, a Resource Owner publishes a JWS-signed menu
(anchor `declared-menu`) naming each operation's class explicitly, and
where that menu verifies and matches, "the declared value alone governs,
replacing the method default rather than being compared against it"
(lines 826-830). (docs/archive/prd.md:10-21)

The method default is a reliable floor in one direction and not the
other. The 2026-09-01 CAMARA catalogue survey in the other repo
(`justabit:ietf/v3/poc/spike-a/`, 292 operations across 60 repositories)
found zero operations judged `x` behind a safe method — the leak
direction is closed. But 57 of 138 POST operations are named as reads
(`retrieve-`, `check-`, `verify-`, `status-`prefixed — the exact
predicate catalogue this project targets: SimSwap `/check`,
NumberVerification `/verify`, `retrieve-location`, KYC match), and every
one classes as `x` under `classSource` method, because POST defaults to
`x` regardless of what the operation actually does.
(docs/archive/prd.md:22-31)

The declared menu already exists in the spec to fix this. The
bottleneck is that nobody wants to hand-classify hundreds of operations
across dozens of repositories to author the menu in the first place.
(docs/archive/prd.md:33-35)

**rwxmap is the author's own tool, first.** It reads an OpenAPI document
and draws a map of which operation is `r`, `w`, or `x`, so an agent, a
guard, a harness, or a classic workflow knows what a call does before it
is made, and so a mechanical arbiter outside the auth agent can see what
agents do. It is a discovery tool, not a proof. It also serves as a
supporting proof-of-concept for -02's actionClass axis and declared
menu, but it is **not load-bearing** for that draft or for any CAMARA
filing — it may ship imperfect. It is also useful on its own as a
stopgap "upfront" map when an API owner is slow to publish a declared
menu, or has none. (docs/archive/prd.md:37-48)

## Out of scope

- A model/LLM tier. There is no tier 2 and no tier 3 in this design.
- A default of `r`, or any guess path.
- Signing. Output stops at a candidate map; a signature is the Resource
  Owner's act.
- Anything normative in an Internet-Draft.
- A third standards track.
- A mandated conformance harness.
- A CLI, packaging, or UI before M3 passes.
- A claim of coverage outside the CAMARA test bed.

(docs/archive/prd.md:133-145)

For the module ladder that M3 refers to, see the
[module ladder page](../wiki/module-ladder-and-shape.md).

## The safety spine

Output classes are `r < w < x`, per the -02 axis-registry ordering
(anchor `action-class-values`: "actionClass is an ordered enumeration
with three values, r, w, and x, ranked r < w < x"). (docs/archive/prd.md:478-480)

When the tool does not know, or when its confidence is below the set
line, **the answer is the tighter class.** The tool never loosens
without evidence. Defaulting to `r` would be fail-open and a security
hole: `r` is the least restrictive class on the actionClass axis, so a
delegation restricted to reads would admit whatever operation the
classifier guessed wrong on — including a destructive one.
(docs/archive/prd.md:482-487)

This changes the outline's framing. The outline said "omit the
operation" — that was right for a signed menu a Resource Owner authors,
and is still what a verifier does per the -02 quotes above (on any menu
failure, or on no menu at all, "the verifier MUST fall back to the
method default," and "A verifier MUST NOT construct or synthesize a
menu entry ... on behalf of a resource owner that has not published
one," anchor `classification`, lines 826-827, 837-839). rwxmap's
consumers are agents and guards that need an answer for every
operation, not a verifier consuming a signed menu, so rwxmap answers
with the tightest class instead of omitting. Both are the same rule: no
loosening without evidence. (docs/archive/prd.md:489-499)

Two error directions, counted and reported separately, never collapsed
into one accuracy number:

- **Over-classification** — a rule proposes a class stricter than the
  operation's actual behavior warrants. Cost: usability. A Resource
  Owner who signs an over-classified menu makes their own catalogue
  harder to delegate against than it needs to be.
- **Under-classification** — a rule proposes a class looser than the
  operation's actual behavior warrants. Cost: security. This is the
  failure the safety spine exists to keep out of the trust path.

(docs/archive/prd.md:501-510)

A single accuracy figure hides the one that matters. Report both
counts, every time, as justabit's `docs/logs/findings.md` already does
for leak-direction and usability findings. This repo's own log starts
at M4. (docs/archive/prd.md:512-514)

For the module that produces these counts and the go/no-go gate built
on them, see the [module ladder page](../wiki/module-ladder-and-shape.md)
and the [go/no-go gate page](../logs/gate-and-m0-results.md).

## Direction

Both directions are in scope. The tool proposes loosening (POST → `r`
or `w`) and tightening (DELETE or PUT → `x` when the verb says
destructive, e.g. `terminateCall`). For the -02 story this means "a
menu replaces the method default in both directions," not only "fixes
POST over-classification." Whether tightening becomes part of the -02
argument or stays a demonstration is open — see Open questions below —
and depends on how many tighten cases M0 finds. (docs/archive/prd.md:518-527)

This is D4; see the [decisions log](../wiki/decisions-log.md) for the
full ruling record.

## Open questions

Non-blocking; never silently assumed.

- Whether tightening enters the -02 argument, or stays a demonstration
  (D4, M4).
- The exact confidence formula and line — M0 finds it.
- The output file format: the -02 declared menu's `{iss, menu}` shape
  (anchor `declared-menu`), or rwxmap's own JSON with a converter.
- The GitHub remote is `hamr0/rwxmap`; visibility (public with a WIP
  marker, like the author's other repos, or private) is decided at the
  first push.
- Whether the -02 draft's definition of `x` is amended to name
  consequence in the test and not only in the label. This is rwxmap's
  first finding with a consequence for the draft text, and it belongs
  to the justabit track to accept or reject.
- Input adapters beyond OpenAPI. The arbiter is a function of a method,
  a name, and a text; GraphQL (`query` vs `mutation`), gRPC/AIP custom
  methods, AsyncAPI, and MCP tool lists can each feed those three
  through a small adapter, with the method empty where the format has
  none. Deferred until the output contract exists; the MCP tool-list
  adapter is the strongest candidate to go first.
- The three questions opened on 2026-09-07 — the `x` definition, the
  DELETE/PUT default, and the gate's treatment of low-confidence rows —
  were decided the same day; see D20, D21 and D22 in the decisions log.
- Preflight against a mock: run an agent against a mock server built
  from the OpenAPI file (e.g. Prism), record which operations it
  reaches for, look each up in the map, and show the x calls before any
  token is issued. HTTP has no dry run; vendor test modes exist for
  some APIs only. Raised by the user 2026-09-07; a later module, not
  M1.
- Closed 2026-09-07 (D31): queryAssistant is truth `r`; ask-an-assistant
  reads back an answer and reaches no one. It is not a negative
  control.
- Does the ordered r < w < x scale still hold once `destructive` is a
  separate axis? A grant of `x` currently implies `w`; with two axes a
  consumer may want "`x`, non-destructive only." The draft's scope
  grammar needs a word for that. Raised 2026-09-07.
- Closed 2026-09-07 (D32): a read whose result arrives by callback is
  `r`; the caller named the sink, so it reaches no one else. Callbacks
  raise only when the lead verb is not a read (M1-C7).
- Which structural fields qualify for a rule, per set, by the user's
  criterion "present consistently or almost always"? Answered by the
  M1 census, pending 2026-09-07.
- Truth re-read owed (raised by M1-C9/C10): the judge names the E24
  arguable rows and three GitHub rows (repos/delete,
  issues/set-issue-field-values, issues/remove-sub-issue) as the only
  leaks that block the summary-verb source. The user re-reads; nothing
  is re-labelled by the tool.
- Over-tight rows are a usability cost invisible to humans at run time;
  how a consumer surfaces or overrides them is open.
- Closed 2026-09-08 (D35): the no-text tighten rule (Rule A) is
  adopted — a PUT/DELETE/PATCH with no summary and no description ->
  x, marked no-text. Hold-out 3 became a tuning set to decide it;
  hold-out 4 is the new clean exam.
- Owner-declared notify flags (e.g. x-github.triggersNotification:
  true) as a raise-only step: zero leaks, tiny coverage; admit as an
  exact vendor-key list?
